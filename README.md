# Welcome to Melodify 

[melodify](https://melodify.herokuapp.com/) - a music streaming app that allows users to play and share their favorite songs. Inspired by popular music streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify, the app was developed using a combination of Python, Flask, React, Redux, Postgres, and SQLAlchemy.

One of the unique features of the app is the ability to convert music files into a binary format for storage in the database and efficient retrieval when a user plays a song. This process involves converting the files from the frontend to a binary format and then back to a bytearray in Python. In addition to this, the app features a custom-built player that was designed to replicate the sleek and intuitive style of the Apple Music player. Building the player from scratch allowed me to learn a lot about audio player design and functionality, without relying on pre-existing npm packages.
